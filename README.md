# Data Structures and Algorithms Assessment - Phase 3 Week 2

In the same files or different scripts code out the following functions:

## Stacks

Question 1: Implement a function is_balanced(expression) that takes a string 
containing parentheses, curly braces, and square brackets,and determines whether 
the expression is balanced. 

An expression is considered balanced if each opening bracket has a corresponding closing 
bracket in the correct order.  

[Question 1: Solution](/assessment1.py)

### sample input:
```
expression1 = "([]{})"
expression2 = "([)]"
print(is_balanced(expression1))  # Output: True
print(is_balanced(expression2))  # Output: False 
```

## Sequences (Lists/Tuples)

Question 2: Write a function remove_duplicates(sequence) that takes a 
sequence (list or tuple) and returns a new sequence with duplicates 
removed while maintaining the original order of elements.  

[Question 2: Solution](/assessment2.py)

### sample input:
```
input_sequence = [2, 3, 2, 4, 5, 3, 6, 7, 5]
result = remove_duplicates(input_sequence)
print(result)  # Output: [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
```

## Dictionaries

Question 3: Implement a function word_frequency(sentence) that takes 
a sentence and returns a dictionary containing the frequency of each 
word in the sentence. 

Ignore punctuation and consider words in a case-insensitive manner.  

[Question 3: Solution](/assessment3.py)

### sample input:

```
sentence = "This is a test sentence. This sentence is a test."
result = word_frequency(sentence)
print(result)
```
